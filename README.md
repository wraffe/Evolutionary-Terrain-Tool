# Evolutionary-Terrain-Tool
A virtual terrain development tool for novice designers. Written in Matlab.
Takes sample heightmap terrains, deconstructs them into patches, a recombines them to form new terrains.
The user can then use interactive evolution with various patch sizes, overlap sizes, and mutation/crossover rates to
refine and search for a terrain.

Details of this can tool can be found in the GECCO conference paper "Evolving patch-based terrains for use in video games"
and the thesis "Personalized Procedural Map Generation in Games via Evolutionary Algorithms", which can both be found at
